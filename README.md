# Digital-Clock-in-Assembly-8086

This program is an alarm clock written in assembly language for the emu8086 emulator. It allows users to set an alarm by inputting the desired hour, minute, and second. The program then continuously displays the current time and checks if it matches the set alarm time. If the alarm time is reached, it displays an "Alarm!" message.

## Features

- **Set alarm functionality:** Users can input the desired hour, minute, and second for the alarm.
- **Increment and decrement time:** Users can increment and decrement the hour and minute using keyboard inputs 'a', 's', 'd', and 'f', respectively.
- **Continuous display:** The program continuously displays the current time and updates it every second.
- **Alarm notification:** When the current time matches the set alarm time, the program displays an "Alarm!" message.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in an emu8086 emulator or a compatible environment.
2. Follow the prompts to set the alarm hour, minute, and second.
3. Use keyboard inputs 'a' and 's' to increment and decrement the hour, respectively.
4. Use keyboard inputs 'd' and 'f' to increment and decrement the minute, respectively.
5. Once the alarm is set, the program will continuously display the current time and check if it matches the set alarm time.
6. When the alarm time is reached, an "Alarm!" message will be displayed.

**DISCLAIMER:** The program is designed to run in the emu8086 emulator environment. It may require adjustments for compatibility with other assembly language emulators or environments.
